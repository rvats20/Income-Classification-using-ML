## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict whether an individual's income exceeds a certain threshold based on demographic and employment-related features. This can be useful for various applications, including targeted marketing, financial analysis, and social studies.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Model Training:** Implementing various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model parameters for better performance.
- **Visualization:** Plotting feature importance, confusion matrix, and ROC curves.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Income-Classification-using-ML.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Income-Classification-using-ML
   ```
3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the project, use the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Model Architecture

The project explores various machine learning models, including:

- **Logistic Regression:** A simple yet effective linear model for binary classification.
- **Decision Trees:** A non-linear model that splits data based on feature values.
- **Random Forests:** An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees for better performance.
- **Gradient Boosting:** An advanced ensemble method that builds models sequentially to correct errors of previous models.

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy:** The proportion of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision:** The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
- **Recall:** The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.
- **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
